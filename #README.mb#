How to Play
Each player rolls the dice at the start of the turn. If it is a double, you get to roll again. But it you get 3 doubles, you will go to jail. 
If you land on a property, you can buy it. If it is owned, you must pay rent to the owner. (You pay double if they own a monopoly, and more if there are houses or hotels.
If you have a monopoly of that color, you can buy houses for the properties that you land on. Note that you have to buy at least 1 house on each of the respective tiles of that color, before a 2nd and so forth. When you have 4 on each of the properties, you can then buy a hotel.
If you land on a Chance or Community Chest tile, you will draw the respective card, which will do something. (Most work for now)

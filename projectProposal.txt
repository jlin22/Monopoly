Project Title
Monopoly

I. Project Idea
Multiplay, Strategy, Boardgame. 
Starting from 2 players, up to 4 players.

There is a board with 10 tiles on each side, (of 4 sides).
There are different kinds of tiles:
-Chance: Card that affects actions in the game, usually with a bigger reward or punishment that Community Chest
-Community Chest: Card that affects actions in the game
-Property: Tiles where you can purchase.
-Utilities: Simialar to properties.
-Railroads: Also similar to properties.
-Jail: A place where you go upon rolling 3 doubles, getting a card that sends you there, or landing on a tile that sends you there.

The whole board will be displayed in GUI with a sidebar that allows for interactions such as rolling, buying, selling, and trading.

The standard rules of Monopoly are going to be implemented as best as possible.
